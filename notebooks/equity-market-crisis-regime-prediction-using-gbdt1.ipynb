    "- The Risk Aversion metrics include the equities’ and G10/emerging currencies’ implied volatilities, the High Yield corporate credit bonds credit spreads, and the shape of the VIX forward curve, defined as the ratio of the VIX Spot over the VIX three-month forward. These indicators characterize the financial assets’ liquidity conditions or the accessibility of funding, two complementary measures of risk appetite.\n",
    "- Financial metrics include the one month, six months and one year growth of Earnings per Share, Price/Earnings and Price/Sales for each equity index. These indicators predict the earnings and sales growth cycle, while providing an insight into valuation multiples changes.\n",
    "- Macroeconomic indicators consist of the Citigroup Economic Surprise indices in the main economic zones (US,EU, Japan, Emerging, Worldwide). These indicators convey the cycle of positive or negative economic surprises on a daily basis.\n",
    "- US Yields change (10 years yield, 2 years yield, 10 year breakeven, US Libor) over the same horizons: one month, six months and one year. A change in yields may either reflect the business cycle, the inflation cycle, or the monetary stance of the Federal Reserve.\n",
    "- The steepness of the US yield curve is also computed as a difference between the government bond yield rate and the short term LIBOR rate on two distinct maturities (10 years, 2 years). This indicator is a well-known predictor of the economic cycle as it computes the spread between long term and short term rates.\n",
    "- Technical indicators comprise the put/call ratio (as provided by the CBOE), and the market breadth (the percentage of individual stocks above their respective 200 days Moving Average) on the six equity indices and the MSCI World ACWI. The Put/Call ratio may reflect extreme optimism or pessimism in the investors’ consensus while market breadth characterizes the unweighted average participation of individual stocks among the global equity indices.\n",
    "- technical indicators from various asset classes are analyzed:\n",
    "    - Excess returns of six equity indices, BCOM Energy and Industrial Metals, FX Emerging Bloomberg Index Excess Return (reflecting the aggregate evolution of 8 emerging currencies vs. the dollar), dollar index, as computed by the ICE US. Returns are computed over the same time horizons as before (one month, six months and one year),\n",
    "    - Historical volatilities, computed over horizons of 10,20 and 30 days,\n",
    "    - Distance to 250 days and 500 days moving average.\n",
    "    - Sharpe Ratios of all the above-mentioned assets, evaluated over horizons of 6 months and 1 year.\n",
